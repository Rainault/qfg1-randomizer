*This is a post I made to the QFG Speedrunners Discord following the release of v1.2.0. It was suggested that I upload the post to GitHub for the benefit of people not on the Discord, and I also saw the benefits of having it here for posterity.*

Hey everyone. I need to get this off my chest, because it wrecked my sleep last night, and I could use some closure on this. Some of you might conclude that I'm making a big deal out of nothing. If you do, I ask that you indulge me. My emotions are a bit of a mess right now, so I think I need to get all of this out.
 
First, some context. I released v1.2.0 of the randomizer last night. It added eight new item drop locations to the game. One of them requires the player to visit Erasmus. He and Fenrus have some witty banter, and then Erasmus gives you the item drop.
 
Here is the interaction as it existed in v1.2.0:

> \<Erasmus\> It is a customary practice for resident Wizards to offer a gift to adventurers who arrive in their domain.  
> \<Fenrus\> Must be called a "practice" because you're still not very good at it.  
> \<Erasmus\> Well, it's not my fault we haven't been getting any adventurers lately.  
> \<Fenrus\> Yes it is.  The last adventurer who visited didn't seem to care much for your gift.  
> \<Erasmus\> I happen to think that a Monster Lure enchantment is a perfect gift for one seeking adventure.  
> \<Fenrus\> What you call "adventure," others would call "hexual harassment."
 
First and foremost: I'm sorry for writing this joke. It was insensitive of me. I wish it didn't require seeing other people's reactions to the joke to realize it. But here we are.
 
The joke has been rewritten in v1.2.0.1. I plan on rewriting it again in v1.2.1. More on that later.
 
I think the best way for me to get closure on this is to break this down and talk about why the joke was inappropriate. There are two major problems that I see.
 
The first problem is that of tone. Erasmus and Fenrus are a comedic duo. They banter and poke fun at each other. And I was hoping to play into that. See, when I started working on the Erasmus drop, I needed a reason for why he was giving you a gift. You can see the answer I came up with in the first line. Then I saw the opportunity for Fenrus to play off the word "practice" in a playful way, which felt appropriate. I then started imagining what ridiculous unwanted gift Erasmus could give someone, and I remembered the image in the introduction of the Saurus Rex chasing the hero. Seemed like a funny enough idea.
 
Then I needed a punchline. I thought of synonyms of "enchantment" and came up with "hex". And there's a really obvious word that rhymes with "hex". Thus, "hexual harassment" came easily to mind, and I typed it in without giving it sufficient thought.
 
The thing is, Erasmus has this dual personality of a wise and powerful wizard, while also being a bit of a doddering old fool. Fenrus pokes fun at him for not always being as wise as he would appear to be -- for a good example of this, check out their interaction when you type "ask about magic".
 
So what happens when Fenrus pokes fun at one of Erasmus' mistakes by making a pun about sexual harassment?
 
The image of Erasmus being an innocent old man suddenly has a hole poked in it. And Fenrus' jabs feel a bit less playful.
 
It's related to that rule of comedy about how nobody actually gets hurt. Hero getting chased by a Saurus Rex? Hilarious! Wizard applying enchantment on someone without their permission? Uh...
 
Even if you actually wanted to make a joke like that, it requires a certain tone for it to fit. And Quest for Glory is absolutely not that tone. "Hexual harassment" is the kind of joke that belongs in a game of Cards Against Humanity, and I shouldn't have considered including it.
 
The second problem is a deeper issue, and it requires going into the v1.2.0.1 rewrite of the joke. The only line that has changed is Fenrus' last line. Here's the rewrite:
 
> \<Erasmus\> I happen to think that a Monster Lure enchantment is a perfect gift for one seeking adventure.  
> \<Fenrus\> The next time you have the urge to thaumaturge and force your sorcery, be sure your charm won't cause any harm.
 
It's better. Feels a bit more like a Fenrus-style joke, considering their love of rhymes. And it was the best thing I could come up with before going to bed last night, as I desperately wanted something, anything, to replace the original joke.
 
But it still doesn't quite feel right. Specifically, the "force your sorcery" part. Setting aside the metaphor of what, exactly, is getting forced here, we start getting into the issue of consent, which is at the heart of the problem.
 
The thing is, "hexual harassment" is a joke that mechanically works pretty well. That's why I was drawn to it. But I didn't think deeply about why the joke works until last night, which is truly unfortunate because it makes me feel pretty gross now when I think about it:
 
Casting an enchantment on someone without their consent happens to be a pretty good analogy for sexual harassment.
 
... Yeah.
 
So the "force your sorcery" part has got to go. Humor-wise, I think the rhyme works better with just the two urge/thaumaturge and charm/harm pairs anyway. But part of me wonders whether the joke itself is ruined, and I should take a completely different tack. I don't want people feeling uncomfortable every time they visit Erasmus because they still remember the original joke.
 
So yeah. I made a mistake. And I'm sorry. It was important for me to analyze it and break it down, because I don't think it's very helpful to leave things at "joke offended people, so take it down, apologize, and feel bad". It was better for me to really try to understand what was wrong with it so I know what lessons to take into the future.
 
I hope you're all still enjoying the randomizer. I'm always open to feedback whenever you have something to share. And thanks to those who called me out on this one.
